Here's a task management system I wrote in 2008 using my redphp framework.
You can setup by installing this and redphp into the same folder, then setting your hosts file to /onetask/public.
You will need to import 'dbase.sql' in the /etc/ folder.
The default username and password is: Administrator/password.

I like this task management system and use it myself, I hope to push several updates as it is not at this point complete, however it is somewhat useable.

If you're a budding PHP developer looking for an easy project to pick up, this one might be for you; as it uses a simple MVC framework I wrote with "training new developers" in mind.
